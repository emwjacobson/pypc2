## Credit
The project [pyracedash](https://github.com/kuathadianto/pyracedash/) was similar to the idea I had in mind. It gave me the idea to use pygame as the graphics library, helped with the implementation of fetching data from CREST2, as well as rendering items.

## About
Recently I have been playing Project Cars 2, and learned about the telemetry system that it offers. I looked into what was already made for it, and decided to make my own.

## Requirements
[CREST2](https://github.com/viper4gh/CREST2) running on the PC you have Project Cars 2 installed.
Python3.6 and venv module
pip

## Install
 - Initialize venv with Python3.6 (pygame requirement)
	 - `python3.6 -m venv .`
 - Activate venv
	 - `source bin/activate`
 - Install pip requirements
	 - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run
- Activate virtualenv
	- `source bin/activate`
- Run 'er
	- `python main.py`
